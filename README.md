This repository contains source code and documentation for R script that was implemented as course project 
assignment for Coursera Data Science - Getting And Cleaning data. Main purpose of this script is to create a tidy 
dataset of multiple data source files. 

Script: run_analysis.R

More information about the source data is available at: [Human Activity Information Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

##Files

The script is using multiple source files to create tidy data set. The source data set is from Human Activity Regognition Using Smartphones, generated
by a group of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Original dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip )

This repository contains also file CodeBook.md which explains the used data and the functions of the run_analysis.R script more detailed.

R scripts generates an output file (tidy_mean.txt) which is also available in the repository.
